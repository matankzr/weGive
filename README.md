WeGive is a mobile platform that is all about charity and doing good to yourself and
other people.

WeGive is the first app that connects users, individual recipients, charitable organizations, and businesses altogether.

As the world has become more digitalized, more tasks are being performed with greater ease via the internet. One aspect of life that has yet to be radically affected by the digital revolution is the way in which we donate money. Many of the groups or individuals that could most benefit from donations remain largely unreached or overlooked.
WeGive aims to make giving easier by addressing the main obstacles to donations.

WeGive is a basic, donation-themed mobile application written in Kotlin and using Firebase. 

* Register a new account using Firebase. Upload profile picture and save basic information to firebase.
* Simulate making a donation. The user can scroll through a list of charities or list of people and donate directly, or scan a QR code to make a donation. 
* Simulate making a purchase, based on given myCoins balance.



<h2>Notes</h2>
To simulate the QR code feature, you must generate a QR code based on some text (i.e., a name or id), and then upload the QR image to your emulator. You can generate a QR code using https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/. The app using the encoded text as the name of the donation recipient.
